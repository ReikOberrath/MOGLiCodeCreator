# This file the is the place to define MetaInfoValidators for all MetoInfos used by the VelocityModelBasedInserter.
# These validators are executed by the StandardModelProvider to validate the MetaInfos
# used in its model file and to build a statistics file on the MetaInfo usage.
# The statistics file is useful to find MetaInfoValidators or MetaInfos
# that are not (any more) in use.
#
# For information how to define MetaInfoValidators, see MetaInfo.validation of the VelocityClassBasedGenerator.
