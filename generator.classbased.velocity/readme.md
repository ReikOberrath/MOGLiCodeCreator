The MOGLiCC **generator.classbased.velocity** project provides the functionality to generated new source files. Class based means, that for each input artefact and each class defined in the model one output artifact (target file) is generated. A single target file is based on the data of one single class defined in the model. The VelocityClassbasedGenerator depends on the plugins StandardModelProvider and the VelocityEngineProvider.
