# This file the is place to define MetaInfoValidators for the VelocityClassBasedGenerator.
# MetaInfoValidators are used by the StandardModelProvider to validate the MetaInfos
# used in its model file and to build a statistics file on the MetaInfo usage.
# The statistics file is useful to find MetaInfoValidators or MetaInfos
# that are not (any more) in use.
#
# Syntax ( |-Symbols are part of the key words ! ):
#
# |MetaInfo| <name of MetaInfo> |is| <Validation Type> |for| <Hierarchy Level Descriptor> |in| <name of valid model> |.|
#
# Possible values for <Validation Type> are "optional" and "mandatory"
# Possible values for <Hierarchy Level Descriptor> are "model", "classes" and "attributes"
#
# Alternatively, the number of allowed occurrences can be defined by
#
# |MetaInfo| <name of MetaInfo> |is valid to occur| <occurrence> |time(s) for| <Hierarchy Level Descriptor> |in| <name of valid model> |.|
#
# Values for <occurrence> are e.g. "0"   (defines a forbidden validator)
#                                  "1"   (defines an mandatory validator)
#                                  "0-3" (Minimum and maximum allowed)
#                                  "any" (defines an optional validator)
#
# In addition, a MetaInfo value can be validated with its value:
#
# |MetaInfo| <name of MetaInfo> |with value| <value of MetaInfo> |is valid to occur| <occurrence> |time(s) for| <Hierarchy Level Descriptor> |in| <name of valid model> |.|
#
# To define Conditional Validators the following syntax exists:
#
# |MetaInfo| <name of MetaInfo> |is valid to occur| <occurrence> |time(s) for| <Hierarchy Level Descriptor> |in| <name of valid model> |if| <name of condition file> |is true.|
#
# A condition file is a separate file (located relatively to its validation file)
# that contains one or more conditions in one or more condition blocks
# defined by the following syntax:
#
# |if MetaInfo| <name of another MetaInfo> |with value| <value of the other MetaInfo> |exists.|
#
# The value information is optional. In addition, it is possible to define exclusion conditions, for example:
#
# |if MetaInfo| JavaType |with value| String |does not exist.|
# |if MetaInfo| JavaType |exists.|
#
# Conditions separated by line breaks (without Block sepatator) represent a condition block.
# Conditions within the same condition block are linked by an AND-Relation (conjunction).
# As Block separator serves a line with content "OR".
# As indicated by the block separator, condition blocks are linked by an OR-Relation (disjunction).
#
# In case the overall condition defined by its condition file is false, the validator returns true.
# This means, the occurence and value of the MetaInfo is not validated (i.e. ignored)
# because the failing condition shows the irrelevance of this validator.
