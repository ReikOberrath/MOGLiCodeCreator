The MOGLiCC **generator.modelbased.filestructure** project provides the functionality to generator an artifact consisting of a structure of folders, subfolders and files. Model based means, that for each input artefact exactly one output artifact is generated and that MetaInfo elements of the model defined in the model file van be used when defining the artifact properties. The VelocityClassbasedGenerator depends only on the StandardModelProvider plugin.
