0.  Verify your are working on the master branch.
1.  Execute all Unit tests (use UnitTestExecutor.java).
2.  Execute 'mvn install' on parent. This verifies that unit tests are successful not only running in Eclipse IDE
    and prepares the integration tests!
3.  Execute integration tests (Start 'Run as JUnit Test' on inttest).
4.  Execute unit test for ReleaseBuilder (use BuildTestExecutor.java).
5.  Check for correct version settings in following three files:
    a) application/src/main/resources/build.properties,
    b) readme.md in root
    c) core/src/main/resources/MOGLi Code Creator.htm
6.  Add release notes in readme.md in root
7.  In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' assure that 'testRun' equals 'false'.
8.  Execute 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java' as JUnit test. This builds the release candidate
    and executes the system tests automatically on it.
9.  Open 'help/MOGLi Code Creator.htm' of unzipped (!) Release Candidate in a web browser and check
    a) Is the file readable? If not, encoding of file in repository is not UTF-8!
    b) Is MOGLiCC version correct?
    c) Are all links working?
10. Verify that in 'application/releaseBuilds' the Release Candidate can be found.
    If not check that property 'testRun' is 'false' in file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties'.
11. Commit the current state to the master with comment 'Release x.y.z'.
12. Checkout the github branch, merge with the master and push to the github remote repository.
13. Checkout the master branch again.
14. In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' adapt the three version settings to new values
15. In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' set 'testRun' back to 'true'.
    This allows test runs of the release process executed automatically by 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java'.
16. Commit source code in git and push it to iks gitblit remote repository.
