1.  Execute all Unit tests (use UnitTestExecutor.java).
2.  Execute 'mvn install' on parent. This verifies that unit tests are successful not only running in Eclipse IDE
    and prepares the integration tests!
3.  Execute integration tests (Start 'Run as JUnit Test' on inttest).
4.  Execute unit test for ReleaseBuilder (use BuildTestExecutor.java).
5.  Check for correct version settings in following three files:
    a) application/src/main/resources/build.properties,
    b) readme.md
    c) core/src/main/resources/MOGLi Code Creator.htm
6.  In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' assure that 'testRun' equals 'false'.
7.  Execute 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java' as JUnit test. This builds the release candidate
    and executes the system tests automatically on it.
8.  In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' adapt the three version settings to new values
9.  In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' set 'testRun' back to 'true'.
    This allows test runs of the release process executed automatically by 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java'.
10. Verify that in 'application/releaseBuilds' the Release Candidate can be found.
    If not check that property 'testRun' is 'false' in file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties'.
11. Commit and tag source code in git and push it to iks gitblit and/or to github remote repositories.
12. Open 'help/MOGLi Code Creator.htm' of unzipped (!) Release Candidate in a web browser and check
    a) Is the file readable? If not, encoding of file in repository is not UTF-8!
    b) Is MOGLiCC version correct?
    c) Are all links working?
