1. Execute all Unit tests (use UnitTestExecutor.java).
2. Execute 'mvn install' on parent. This verifies that unit tests are successful not only running in Eclipse IDE 
   and prepares the integration tests!
3. Execute integration tests (Start 'Run as JUnit Test' on inttest).
4. Check for correct version settings in following three files:
   a) application/src/main/resources/build.properties, 
   b) application/readme.md 
   c) core/src/main/resources/MOGLi Code Creator.htm
5. In file 'application/src/main/resources/test.properties' assure that 'setVersionInPomsBackToOldValue' equals 'false'.
6. Execute 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java' as JUnit test. This builds the release candidate 
   and executes the system tests automatically on it.
7. In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' adapt the three version settings to new values
8. In file 'application/src/main/resources/test.properties' set 'setVersionInPomsBackToOldValue' back to 'true'.
   This allows test runs of the release process executed automatically by 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java'.
9. Commit and tag source code in git and push it to iks gitblit and/or to github remote repositories.
