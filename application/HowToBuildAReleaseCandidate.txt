1.  Verify: current branch is master and all necessary changes from other branches have been merged.
2.  Execute all Unit tests (use UnitTestExecutor.java).
3.  Execute 'mvn install' on parent. This verifies that unit tests are successful not only running in Eclipse IDE
    and prepares the integration tests!
4.  Execute integration tests (Start 'Run as JUnit Test' on inttest).
5.  Check for correct version settings in following three files:
    a) application/src/main/resources/build.properties,
    b) readme.md in root
    c) core/src/main/resources/MOGLi Code Creator.htm
6.  Add changes to last version to the version history (release notes)
7.  Execute unit test for ReleaseBuilder (use BuildTestExecutor.java) if Release Builder Code has changed.
8.  In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' assure that 'testRun' equals 'false'.
9.  Execute 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java' as JUnit test. This builds the release candidate
    and executes the system tests automatically on it.
10. Open 'help/MOGLi Code Creator.htm' of unzipped (!) Release Candidate in a web browser and check
    a) Is the file readable? If not, encoding of file in repository is not UTF-8!
    b) Is MOGLiCC version correct?
    c) Are all links working?
11. Verify that in 'application/releaseBuilds' the Release Candidate can be found.
    If not check that property 'testRun' is 'false' in file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties'.
12. Check that a tag for the current release was automatically created - if not do it manually (pattern: vx.y.z).
13. In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' adapt the three version settings to new values
14. In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' set 'testRun' back to 'true'.
    This allows test runs of the release process executed automatically by 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java'.
15. Commit the current state to the master with comment 'Release x.y.z'.
16. Checkout the github branch, merge with the master and push to the github remote repository.
17. Checkout the master branch again.
