The MOGLiCC **inserter.modelbased.velocity** project provides the functionality to insert generated code into existing files. Model based means, that for each artefact to generate exactly one target file exists. Into the target file the data of the complete model may be inserted. The plugin built from this model depends on the StandardModelProvider and the VelocityEngineProvider.
