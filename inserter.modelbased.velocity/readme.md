The MOGLiCC **inserter.modelbased.velocity** project provides the functionality to insert generated code into existing files. Model based means, that for each input artefact exactly one target file must exist. Into the target file a block of lines are generated for each class within the model. The VelocityModelbasedInserter depends on the plugins StandardModelProvider and the VelocityEngineProvider.
